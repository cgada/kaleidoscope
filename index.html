                        <h2> What is Colour Blindness? </h2>
                        <div id="description">
                          About 8% of all men and 0.5% of all women are colourblind. The most common form is red-green colour blindness which affects much more men than women, as it is encoded on the x-chromosome (sex-linked) and usually inherited from a mother to her son.

But Colour blindness is not ‘colour blindness’! There are still many people who think colourblind people can’t really see any colours. But the term is misleading. More than 99% of all colourblind people can see colours. A better wording would be colour vision deficiency, which describes this visual disorder much more precisely.

                        <h2> The cause of colour blindness </h2>
                        <div>
Colour perception in the human eye is build up by three different types of cones. Each type is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light (red, green, and blue) and every perceived colour is therefore a mixture of stimuli of those three cone types.

Now, if you one of those peaks of sensitivity is shifted towards another one or if one is missing at all, you perceive a narrower colour spectrum—in other words you are colourblind. As a peak can be shifted everything between a little bit and the whole way, any type of severity is possible. The closer the peaks are the more severe is your colour vision deficiency: slightly, moderately, strongly, or absolutely colourblind.

  <h3> This Colour Blindness Simulator is a tool to simulate some form of colour vision deficiency. It should allow you to experience the art at this show through a different lens. Currently, CBS should work on an android phone on a newish browser. </h3>
